Notice: you may want to check and/or adjust the port mapping if you use these on another machine (to avoid port collisions) Otherwise these script directories should be fully self reliant.

Each directory contains the scripts used to load each of the respective graphs into Neo4j (running in docker)
Each directory has all the files required to spin up a neo4j database including the required graph edges/vertices
